 Top Line:
 It's difficult to find complaints against the Xiaomi 14 Ultra - it's big and heavy, but the weight and dimensions are similar to those of its competitors. Its performance is excellent, as is the screen, and the lenses provide exceptional images.
 However, the main argument against the device is the price. For over $1,500 you can purchase an iPhone 15 Pro, which also offers excellent performance, particularly in the realm of photography. Alternatively, you could choose from several different Android models and still have a few hundred bucks left over. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, the Asus Zenfone 11 Ultra, and the OnePlus 12 are all cheaper.
 So, while the Xiaomi 14 Ultra certainly delivers on all fronts, it is difficult, if not impossible, to justify the significant price differences or the same price as a brand that is still considered to be much more desirable.
